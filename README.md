# Consumer Behaviour Prediction

Predict customer purchase intent by combining psychological theory with machine learning, implemented entirely in Google Colab.

## Overview

This project integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with 8 machine learning models to analyze consumer data and forecast buying decisions. It highlights key behavioral drivers and explains model predictions using LIME.

## Features

- Implements TPB framework with ML algorithms in Python  
- Performs hyperparameter tuning and data preprocessing  
- Achieves 92% accuracy using Gradient Boosting  
- Applies LIME for model interpretability  
- Runs fully on Google Colab for easy access and reproducibility  

## Tech Stack

- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)  
- Google Colab  
- LIME for explainability  

## Usage

1. Open the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/your-notebook-link)  
2. Follow the cells to load data, preprocess, train models, and evaluate  
3. Experiment by tuning parameters or switching models  
4. Use LIME visualizations to interpret model outputs  

## Results

- Gradient Boosting achieved 92% accuracy  
- Identified 3 main behavioral factors influencing purchase intent  
- LIME explanations enhance understanding of predictions
